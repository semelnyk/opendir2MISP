# opendir2MISP
This repository contains Python scripts designed for downloading potentially malicious files from open directories sourced from URLHAUS and uploading these files to a MISP. The primary purpose is to automate the process of gathering files from open directories and reporting them to MISP, excluding those that are flagged as malicious by VirusTotal.
